Global Nitrous Oxide Gas Cylinder Market Insights
Nitrous Oxide Gas Cylinder Market size was valued at USD 1.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.9 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2030.

Nitrous Oxide Gas Cylinder Market Overview
The global Nitrous Oxide Gas Cylinder market was valued at approximately USD 1.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach around USD 2.5 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for nitrous oxide across various industries, including medical, food and beverage, and electronics, due to its unique properties and versatile applications. The medical segment held the largest revenue share of 87.6% in 2022, as nitrous oxide is extensively used as an anesthetic and analgesic agent in surgical and dental procedures. The automotive segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% over the forecast period, as nitrous oxide is used to significantly boost engine power by increasing the oxygen content of the fuel mixture. The Asia Pacific region dominated the global market and accounted for the largest revenue share of 35.0% in 2022, driven by factors such as growing population, increasing urbanization, and expanding middle-class population with increased disposable incomes. North America is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% during the forecast period, with the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases supplementing the growth of the regional market. The market is highly competitive and fragmented in nature, with the presence of several key players in the global arena, including Praxair Technology, Inc., Chart Industries, Inc., Linde plc, MATHESON TRI-GAS, INC., SOL GROUP, Merck KGaA, Air Liquide, Airgas, Inc., and Ellenbarrie Industrial Gases. Consumption of nitrous oxide is highly affected by regulations related to nitrous oxide in various countries, which vary from country to country for various application sectors. It is not illegal to sell or possess nitrous oxide; however, there are several laws pertaining to distribution to minors and to recreational inhalation. Source
